# price-sign-vf
Demo of front end for price sign controller using Vue 2.1 and Foundation for Sites 6.3.0.

The target market was single stores or small chains marketing fuel.

I originally created this UI using AngularJS 1.4 and Foundation for Sites 5. It was embedded on a Beaglebone and I had to recreate it to work on a LAMP website. Vue is a much more appropriate JavaScript framework for this project than Angular. I intend to duplicate it using other CSS frameworks.
