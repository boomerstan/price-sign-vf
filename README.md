# price-sign-vf
Demo of front end UI for a price sign controller using Vue 2.1 and Foundation for Sites 6.3.0.

The target market was single stores or small chains marketing fuel.

I originally created this UI using AngularJS 1.4 and Foundation for Sites 5. It was embedded on a Beaglebone Black processor using lighttpd as the web server and Laravel 4 as the backend API. There was a lot more code involved for managing the signs' features, but that was proprietary knowledge. This website was intranet, never public. 

Vue is a much more appropriate JavaScript framework for this project than Angular. I intend to duplicate it using other CSS frameworks.
